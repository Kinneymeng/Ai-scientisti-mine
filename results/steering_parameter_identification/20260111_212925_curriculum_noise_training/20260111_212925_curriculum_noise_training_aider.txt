#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Curriculum Learning with Progressive Noise Injection for Robust Parameter Identification.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Implement curriculum learning where the model is first trained on clean data, then progressively exposed to increasing noise levels. Modify the training loop to start with noise_level=0.001 and gradually increase to the target noise level over the training epochs. Compare against standard training (constant noise) and evaluate robustness by testing on noise levels the model wasn't explicitly trained on. Measure both identification accuracy and generalization to unseen noise conditions..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'ls_cf_error': 1.9082690282704244, 'ls_cr_error': 0.2511336689181755, 'nn_cf_error': 0.0013867187500000001, 'nn_cr_error': 0.0013975694444444446, 'nn_mean_error': 0.0013921440972222224, 'best_method': 0}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.
