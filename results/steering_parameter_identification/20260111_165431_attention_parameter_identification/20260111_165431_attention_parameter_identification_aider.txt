#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Attention-Enhanced Neural Networks for Vehicle Steering Parameter Identification.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the ParameterIdentificationNet to include a self-attention mechanism before the final prediction layers. The attention module will learn to weight different time-steps or input features based on their relevance to parameter identification. Compare the attention-enhanced model against the baseline neural network by measuring Cf and Cr identification errors across different noise levels (0.01, 0.02, 0.05). Track attention weights to analyze which features/time-steps are most informative..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'ls_cf_error': 1.9082690282704244, 'ls_cr_error': 0.2511336689181755, 'nn_cf_error': 0.0013867187500000001, 'nn_cr_error': 0.0013975694444444446, 'nn_mean_error': 0.0013921440972222224, 'best_method': 0}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.

#### Decide if you need to re-plan your experiments given the result (you often will not need to).  
####   
#### Someone else will be using `notes.txt` to perform a writeup on this in the future.
