# Title: Attention-Enhanced Neural Networks for Vehicle Steering Parameter Identification
# Experiment description: Modify the ParameterIdentificationNet to include a self-attention mechanism before the final prediction layers. The attention module will learn to weight different time-steps or input features based on their relevance to parameter identification. Compare the attention-enhanced model against the baseline neural network by measuring Cf and Cr identification errors across different noise levels (0.01, 0.02, 0.05). Track attention weights to analyze which features/time-steps are most informative.
