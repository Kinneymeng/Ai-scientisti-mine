#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Attention-Enhanced Neural Networks for Vehicle Steering Parameter Identification.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the ParameterIdentificationNet to include a self-attention mechanism before the final prediction layers. The attention module will learn to weight different time-steps or input features based on their relevance to parameter identification. Compare the attention-enhanced model against the baseline neural network by measuring Cf and Cr identification errors across different noise levels (0.01, 0.02, 0.05). Track attention weights to analyze which features/time-steps are most informative..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'ls_cf_error': 1.9082690282704244, 'ls_cr_error': 0.2511336689181755, 'nn_cf_error': 0.0013867187500000001, 'nn_cr_error': 0.0013975694444444446, 'nn_mean_error': 0.0013921440972222224, 'best_method': 0}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.

#### Great job! Now criticize and refine only the Conclusion that you just wrote.  
#### Make this complete in this pass, do not leave any placeholders.  
####   
#### Pay particular attention to fixing any errors such as:  
#### - Unenclosed math symbols  
#### - Only reference figures that exist in our directory  
#### - LaTeX syntax errors  
#### - Numerical results that do not come from explicit experiments and logs  
#### - Repeatedly defined figure labels  
#### - References to papers that are not in the .bib file, DO NOT ADD ANY NEW CITATIONS!  
#### - Unnecessary verbosity or repetition, unclear text  
#### - Results or insights in the `notes.txt` that have not yet need included  
#### - Any relevant figures that have not yet been included in the text  
#### - Closing any \begin{figure} with a \end{figure} and \begin{table} with a \end{table}, etc.  
#### - Duplicate headers, e.g. duplicated \section{Introduction} or \end{document}  
#### - Unescaped symbols, e.g. shakespeare_char should be shakespeare\_char in text  
#### - Incorrect closing of environments, e.g. </end{figure}> instead of \end{figure}

#### Please fill in the Related Work of the writeup. Some tips are provided below:  
####   
####   
#### - Academic siblings of our work, i.e. alternative attempts in literature at trying to solve the same problem.   
#### - Goal is to “Compare and contrast” - how does their approach differ in either assumptions or method? If their method is applicable to our Problem Setting I expect a comparison in the experimental section. If not, there needs to be a clear statement why a given method is not applicable.   
#### - Note: Just describing what another paper is doing is not enough. We need to compare and contrast.  
####   
####   
#### For this section, very briefly sketch out the structure of the section, and clearly indicate what papers you intend to include.  
#### Do this all in LaTeX comments using %.  
#### The related work should be concise, only plan to discuss the most relevant work.  
#### Do not modify `references.bib` to add any new citations, this will be filled in at a later stage.
