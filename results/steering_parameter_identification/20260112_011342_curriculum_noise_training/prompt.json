  "task_description": "This codebase implements vehicle steering parameter identification using machine learning methods. The system uses a two-degree-of-freedom bicycle model to simulate vehicle lateral dynamics.\n\nThe bicycle model describes vehicle motion with two key equations:\n1. Lateral force balance: m*v*(beta_dot + r) = Fyf + Fyr\n2. Yaw moment balance: Iz*r_dot = Lf*Fyf - Lr*Fyr\n\nWhere:\n- beta: vehicle sideslip angle\n- r: yaw rate\n- delta: front wheel steering angle\n- v: vehicle longitudinal velocity\n- Fyf, Fyr: front/rear lateral tire forces\n- Cf, Cr: front/rear cornering stiffness (parameters to identify)\n- m: vehicle mass, Iz: yaw moment of inertia\n- Lf, Lr: distances from center of gravity to front/rear axles\n\nThe tire forces use a linear model: Fyf = Cf*alpha_f, Fyr = Cr*alpha_r, where alpha is the slip angle.\n\nThe experiment generates simulation data with various steering maneuvers and measurement noise, then compares different identification methods:\n1. Least Squares (baseline): Classical regression-based identification\n2. Neural Network: Learns to predict cornering stiffness from vehicle states\n3. Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN): Incorporates vehicle dynamics equations as constraints\n\nKey experimental parameters:\n- num_samples: Number of data points for training\n- noise_level: Measurement noise standard deviation (relative)\n- hidden_sizes: Neural network architecture\n- activation: Activation function (relu, tanh, leaky_relu)\n- epochs: Training iterations\n- use_pinn: Enable physics-informed approach\n\nPerformance is measured by parameter identification error (percentage difference from true values).\n\nYour task is to propose novel ideas that could improve parameter identification accuracy, robustness to noise, or generalization. Consider improvements to:\n- Neural network architectures (attention, residual connections, etc.)\n- Training strategies (curriculum learning, data augmentation)\n- Physics-informed approaches (different constraint formulations)\n- Handling of nonlinear tire models\n- Transfer learning across different vehicle configurations\n- Uncertainty quantification in parameter estimates"
